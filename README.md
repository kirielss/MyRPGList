# MyRPGList

## Welcome!

This project is powered by ASP.NET 7.0.

It is a REST API with CRUD into an external database.

I used Entity Framework to do the Object-Relational Mapping into MySQL.

I tried to keep the good practices, like creating RTOs to keep the main data away from the Endpoint Controllers.

I also tried to document the Http methods on Swagger.

## To Do!

I plan to sometime in the future turn back to this project, when i acquire more knowledge, and cross data with Games x Developers X Users, and maybe create a Frontend to run a decent website of this project.
